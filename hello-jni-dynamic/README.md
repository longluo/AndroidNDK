# Hello JNI

Hello JNI is an Android sample that uses JNI to call C code from a Android Java
Activity.

This sample uses the new
[Android Studio CMake plugin](http://tools.android.com/tech-docs/external-c-builds)
with C++ support. For how to use Android Studio, refer to
[Hello-CMake codelab](https://codelabs.developers.google.com/codelabs/android-studio-cmake/index.html)
